1. Time-Series Analysis: For analyzing the historical equipment performance data, including sensor readings and failure records, time-series analysis techniques can be used. Time-series algorithms can help identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data. Techniques like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) could be beneficial in understanding equipment behavior over time.

2. Classification: To predict whether a piece of equipment is likely to fail or not, classification algorithms can be employed. Some popular classification algorithms include Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). These algorithms can learn from historical data and classify equipment instances into failure or non-failure categories.

3. Regression: If you need to predict the remaining useful life or the time until the equipment is likely to fail, regression algorithms can be used. Linear regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks are some of the common regression algorithms that can predict continuous values.

4. Anomaly Detection: Anomaly detection techniques can be useful in identifying abnormal behavior in the equipment's sensor readings or other variables. Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM are examples of algorithms that can help detect unusual patterns.

5. Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is an essential part of the project, and it involves creating meaningful features from the raw data. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), or other domain-specific techniques can help with dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

6. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models can often improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Ensemble methods such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting can be used to combine the predictions from multiple base models.
